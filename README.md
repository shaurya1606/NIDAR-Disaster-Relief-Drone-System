# NIDAR-Disaster-Relief-Drone-System
We are planning to built the system consisting of two drones. Drone A will be the scout drone helps in locating the survival in the flooded region and mark their geo-location. And then Drone B will act as a delivery drone which will help in the delivery of the help kit to the survival.
